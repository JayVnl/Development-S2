Swiss toolbox is a chrome extension that features multiple elements into one extension, the EZ-Dice extension is also implemented as seen in the picture
Furthermore it also features a color picker tool to easily get colors and their hex codes which is always nice to have at hand while 
coding.
And the last feature that it has is a Zoom function that enables once pressed the key combination CTRL + Shift + E.
Once enabled you will notice a border generate over each element that you hover over, when pressed on an element it will show this element in fullscreen and can be discontinued by pressing esc.
